        <p>Hi, I'm Chimemezue Clinton Ezeani, a passionate developer with experience in cloud infrastructure and administration. I have limited web design experience, however I have developed python applications and deployed them on cloud providers like AWS and Azure via Kubernetes.
            I have a keen interest in AI and LLMs and I am constantly thinking of ways to improve human-computer interaction and accessibility by implementing some form of intelligence. I graduated from <a class="hyperlinks" href="https://www.iit.edu">IIT</a> with my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering in Summer 2023</p>
